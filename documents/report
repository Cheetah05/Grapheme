Architecture
------------

The overall grapheme program is split into two fairly distinct parts, the
client and the server. 

The client consists of a webpage, which is the result of  a java to 
javascript translation done by the google web toolkit. The client communicates
with the server via a websocket type interface provided by orbited js. 
The benefit of the websocket interface is that common polling loops that are
seen in web applications are eliminated as well as providing an extremely 
efficient transport mechanism.

The server is written entirely in java and consists of modules to seperate
incoming messages, outgoing messages and message processing.
