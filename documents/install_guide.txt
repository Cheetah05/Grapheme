grapheme has a few dependencies, these are as follows:
java, gwt, ant, gwt-voices, gwt-html5, java json library, junit
and the mongo java driver as well as mongo db

once this is complete, you can compile the project with "ant build"
if this fails, it's commonly because you've missed a depend. If it's
not a missing dependency it's possible that we've broken the build
please check to see if revision a75b16abbc7852365eb3383ac builds.

once the entire compile process is complete (can take upwards of a minute)
copy the WAR folder to your webserver and then restart it. The remaining
services that need to be brought up are orbited, mongo and the java server

the java server can be launched with "run.sh" and this will probably only
work in the grapheme directory for the moment, we'll make this into a proper
deamon type service once we're done developing
